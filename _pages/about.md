# ABOUT ME
## Harshad Ingle, PhD
Functional Genomics Scientist | CRISPR Screening | Target Discovery

I am a functional genomics scientist with deep expertise in CRISPR screening and host–pathogen biology, focused on identifying and validating druggable targets in complex biological systems. My work integrates pooled CRISPR screens, physiologically relevant cell models, and immunology to uncover host dependency factors and viral entry mechanisms. I have led cross-functional screening efforts resulting in first-in-class receptor discoveries as potential targets for antiviral therapies.
