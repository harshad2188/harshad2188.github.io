# ***ABOUT ME***
## Harshad Ingle, PhD
Functional Genomics Scientist | CRISPR Screening | Target Discovery

I am a functional genomics scientist with deep expertise in CRISPR screening and host–pathogen biology, focused on identifying and validating druggable targets in complex biological systems. My work integrates pooled CRISPR screens, physiologically relevant cell models, and immunology to uncover host dependency factors and viral entry mechanisms. I have led cross-functional screening efforts resulting in first-in-class receptor discoveries as potential targets for antiviral therapies.

# ***SCIENTIFIC FOCUS***

## Functional Genomics & CRISPR Screening
I design and execute pooled CRISPR knockout and activation screens to identify host factors and biological pathways relevant to infection, immunity, and therapeutic targeting. My experience spans assay design, screen optimization in complex systems, hit prioritization, and downstream validation.

## Host–Pathogen Interfaces & Viral Entry Biology
I investigate how viruses engage host cellular machinery, with an emphasis on receptor discovery and early entry events. Using functional genomics and mechanistic follow-up, my work has revealed previously unrecognized host receptors and dependency factors that shape viral tropism and pathogenesis.

## Organoids and Complex Biological Models
I develop and apply human intestinal organoids, immune cell coculture systems, and in vivo infection models to interrogate host–pathogen interactions and immune responses in physiologically relevant contexts. These complementary systems provide mechanistic insight and biological context that inform target discovery and downstream validation efforts.

# ***SELECTED CONTRIBUTIONS***

## Human Astrovirus Receptor Discovery
**Nature Microbiology, 2024**
Addressed a long-standing gap in human astrovirus biology by identifying FcRn and DPP4 as viral entry receptors using pooled CRISPR screening and mechanistic follow-up, establishing a generalizable framework for receptor discovery in enteric viruses.

## Physiologically Relevant Astrovirus Infection Models
**Mucosal Immunology, 2021**
Developed human intestinal enteroid systems that enabled replication and study of previously unculturable astrovirus strains, expanding experimental access to clinically relevant virus–host interactions.

## Cell-Type–Specific Interferon Control of Viral Persistence
**Science Advances, 2023**
Elucidated how IFN-λ signaling from non-susceptible epithelial cell populations constrains persistent viral infection, revealing context-dependent immune regulation in the gut.
